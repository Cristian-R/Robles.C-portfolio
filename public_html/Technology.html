         <p>In the technology part of my website i'm going to explain what I used<br>
         to make and design my website. First I started of by making an index page<br>
         to write about myself and the way I did this was by using html it's kind<br>
         of like a computer language that tells the website or anything else your<br>
         making like a video game or an app what to do.</p>

         <article>For designing and making my website the way I wanted it to look I<br>
         used css(cascading style sheet)for things like spacing things like pictures,<br>
         making the background color red, making the links white, or even the font size </article>
